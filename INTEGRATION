#### **Colaboratory** is integrated with Google Drive. It allows you to 
share, comment, and collaborate on the same document with multiple 
people:

The **`SHARE`** button (top-right of the toolbar) allows you to share 
the notebook and control permissions set on it.
- **File**->**Make a Copy** creates a copy of the notebook in Drive.
- **File**->**Save** saves the File to Drive. 
- **File**->**Save and checkpoint** pins the version so it doesn't get 
deleted from the revision history.
- **File**->**Revision history** shows the notebook's revision history.
